Hey there, Flutter enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹ I've embarked on an exciting journey to create seven unique Flutter projects in seven days. Why? Because learning by doing is awesome, and I want to share this adventure with you!
# Day 1: Bouncing Ball Tab Animation
For our first day, we've created a fun and interactive tab animation featuring a bouncing ball. This isn't your average, run-of-the-mill tab bar. Oh no! We've got a playful pink ball that bounces from tab to tab, leaving satisfying dents in its wake. It's like a digital trampoline for your UI!
