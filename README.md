# Welcome to Day 1 of my 7-Day Flutter Challenge! ðŸš€
What's This All About?

https://codinglollypop.medium.com/7-days-of-flutter-fun-a-visual-journey-through-animations-4caeb556403e

Hey there, Flutter enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹ I've embarked on an exciting journey to create seven unique Flutter projects in seven days. Why? Because learning by doing is awesome, and I want to share this adventure with you!
# Day 1: Bouncing Ball Tab Animation
For our first day, we've created a fun and interactive tab animation featuring a bouncing ball. This isn't your average, run-of-the-mill tab bar. Oh no! We've got a playful pink ball that bounces from tab to tab, leaving satisfying dents in its wake. It's like a digital trampoline for your UI!
Features

# Custom-drawn tab bar
Animated bouncing ball effect
Dynamic "dent" animation where the ball lands
Smooth, fluid transitions using custom animation curves

# Getting Started

Navigate to the project directory
Copycd 7-day-flutter-challenge/day1-bouncing-ball-tab

Install dependencies
Copyflutter pub get

Run the app
Copyflutter run


Deep Dive
Want to know how it all works? Check out the detailed tutorial here. We break down the problem, tackle each part step-by-step, and explain the math and logic behind the animations.
Known Issues and Future Improvements

This animation has been tested on Android and iPhone, but may have issues across different screen sizes.
Performance optimizations could be made for smoother animations on lower-end devices.

Feel free to contribute! Whether it's fixing bugs, optimizing performance, or adding new features, your input is welcome.
